# Personal Web Project

This is a simple personal web application built with React. It includes multiple components displayed in a carousel-style layout. The project features smooth navigation with a Bootstrap navbar and uses React Router for seamless routing between components.

## Features

- **Single-page Application**: The entire website is built on a single page with multiple components that are displayed based on user interaction.
- **Carousel Layout**: The components are styled in a carousel layout for a smooth, dynamic user experience.
- **Navbar**: The navbar, built using Bootstrap, includes links to sections such as **Home**, **About**, **Skills**, and **Contact**. Clicking on any of these links smoothly navigates to the respective component.
- **Footer**: The footer includes links to social media platforms.
- **Routing**: React Router is used for routing between different components within the page.
